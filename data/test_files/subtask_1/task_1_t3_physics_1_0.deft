 This change in position is known as displacement .
 The word “ displacement ” implies that an object has moved , or has been displaced .
 2913 . The most obvious method of obtaining better detail is to utilize shorter wavelengths .
 Ultraviolet ( UV ) microscopes have been constructed with special lenses that transmit UV rays and utilize photographic or electronic techniques to record images .
 The shorter UV wavelengths allow somewhat greater detail to be observed , but drawbacks , such as the hazard of UV to living tissue and the need for special detection devices and lenses ( which tend to be dispersive in the UV ) , severely limit the use of UV microscopes .
 2916 . Another type of microscope utilizing wave interference and differences in phases to enhance contrast is called the phase - contrast microscope .
 While its principle is the same as the interference microscope , the phase - contrast microscope is simpler to use and construct .
