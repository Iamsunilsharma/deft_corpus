 We call the hypothetical unified force superforce . Now let us imagine starting at TOE and moving forward in time to see what type of universe is created from various events along the way .
 As temperatures and average energies decrease with expansion , the universe reaches the stage where average particle separations are large enough to see differences between the strong and electroweak forces ( at about 10 − 35 s 10 − 35 s size 12 { " 10 " rSup { size 8 { - " 35 " } } ` s } { } ) .
